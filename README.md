# PHP-Framework
A sophisticated PHP framework for handling basic tasks.

The basic idea behind this framework is to minimize the time spent on doing basic things such as manageing cookies & sessions, form validations, error handling, etc.

The core components in the framework are - 
- Database Class: Provides simple methods for performing database operations such as executing query, fetching results, matching data in database, etc.
- Session & Cookie Classes - Provides methods to quickly handle sessions and cookies.
- Form Class: This class provides an excelent way to do form validations for different data formats. It also provides a wrapper around form data to prevent SQL injection.
